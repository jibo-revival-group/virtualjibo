Jibo Log - Centralized logging facility
=======================================

A module to centralize and control (and log to the cloud or files) all
logging messages. Use this everywhere instead of `console.log` and
friends.

To use:

```
import Log from 'jibo-log';
let log = new Log(module.filename);

log.debug('this is a debug');
log.info('this is an info');
log.warn('this is a warning');
log.error('this is an error');
```

Use `log.debug`, `log.info`, `log.warn`, `log.error`, instead of
`console.log` and friends.

`log.log` is also available, but it's just an alias for log.debug and
is there mainly for compatibility with the console object.

You specify a string to act as the name space of your log messages in
the `new Log()` constructor call. The name space will appear in front
of all your log messages. Name spaces can be configured to show or
discard messages above/below a certain level.

The level order is `debug` < `info` < `warn` < `error`. By default
`debug` messages are not printed to the console, but `info` and above
are. You can use `enableDebug` (below) to enable them for a name
space.

`module.filename` is there in the example above as a default so you
don't have to think about it. If the Log() constructor is given a
string that starts with a `/` (like `module.filename` does), it will
remove everything from the first `/` through the last `/` and use the
remainder as the name space. Thus, `module.filename` will set your
name space to be just the filename of the file that `new
Log(module.filename)` was called from. Using `module.filename` is the
best thing to do most of the time.

You can group multiple source files into the same name space by
specifying the same name by hand (e.g. 'MIM' or 'ASR').


Logging to a file
-----------------

`log.toFile([filename='skill.[ISOtimestamp].log'], [callback])`

Call this once to open up a file that all log statements are appended to, even
`debug` level ones (which are suppressed on the console by default).

A timestamp column in ISO Date format is added as the first column to
all output logged to a file.

If you don't supply a filename the default is 'skill.[ISOtimestamp].log'.
If you want the same timestamps, but want to change the name to not start with 'skill', do this:

```
let logfile = 'notaskill.'+new Date().toISOString();+'.log';
log.toFile(logfile, [callback]);
```

The callback is called once file setup has finished. For backwards
compatability reasons the callback is optional. If you don't supply a
callback you risk not logging some messages to the log file while it
is being setup.

The most typical usage in skills should look like this:

```
log.toFile(null, () => {
   // the continuation of your setup code
});
```

Calling `log.toFile()` multiple times with the same filename is a
no-op. Calling it with different filenames will simultaneously log to
multiple files.


Default logging directory
-------------------------

`log.setDefaultLogDir(directory, callback)`

By default log files are stored in `/var/jibo/logs` (if `/var/jibo`
exists, as it does on the robot) or `~/jibo/logs` (when running on
your computer). Use `log.setDefaultLogDir()` to change the default log
directory (before calling toFile()).

The directory will be created if it doesn't already exist when
toFile() is called.

The callback here is called immediatly and is only here for backwards
compatibility.

If the filename given to `log.toFile()` is an absolute path, it will
be used as is and the default directory will not affect things.  There
will be no attempt to create any directory if an absolute path is
given.


Logging to the cloud
--------------------

`log.toCloud()`

There is code in place to demonstrate logging to the cloud. It
generates a lot of network traffic and needs to be refactored to batch
upload the messages. It is turned off by default. You can turn it on
by calling `log.toCloud()`. It is currently hardwired to go to one
specific account (that will also need to be refactored).


Enabling debug messages
-----------------------

`log.enableDebug([name], [level])`

By default, `debug` level messages are suppressed from the console
(but not to files). Use `log.enableDebug()` to turn them on.

`name` is a string (or regular expression) that specifies the name
space you want to enable `debug` level messages for. If you don't give
a name, it will default to the same name given to `new
Log([name])`. You can specify the names of other modules to turn on
their `log.debug` lines, or even `log.enableDebug(/.*/)` to enable all
debug lines everywhere.

The second argument, level, defaults to 'debug', and it doesn't make
any sense to specify anything else at this point, so just ignore it.


Enabling syslog messages
------------------------

`log.toSyslog()`

By default, syslog messages are disabled. Use `log.toSyslog()` to turn 
them on. However, note that they will only truly be turned on IFF the current 
process' platform is `linux` and architecture is `arm`. 


Logging err indicators
----------------------

`log.iferr(err, [message])`

A common JavaScript (and especially Node.js) convention is to indicate
an error condition as the first argument in a callback (usually named
`err` by convention). Frequently you want to log that such errors
happened, but many times it doesn't affect your program flow because
you still need to call some callback that you were given and are just
going to pass the error upward.

`log.iferr()` prints your message (at the `error` level) only if
`err` is truthy. Your message is *followed* by `err` stringified.

Use this:

```
log.iferr(err, 'error happened');
```

Instead of this:

```
if (err) {
  log.error('error happened', err);
}
```

Your code will be more readable (and you can save a bunch of typing).


Logging uncaught exceptions
---------------------------

`jibo-log` registeres a listener for `uncaughtExceptions` so they can
be logged. If it is the only listener for `uncaughtExceptions` it will
also re-raise the error which will cause the process to exit. If there
are other listeners it will just log the error.


Stack traces
------------

If you log an `Error()` object with stack information on it, and you
are logging to a file, `jibo-log` will include the stack trace
information in the log file (in a slightly messy way
unfortunately). Output to the console may or may not have stack trace
information depending on the environment (plain node output doesn't
seem to include it, but the Electron console does).

`log.error()` does not currently trigger a stack trace all by itself
(but does if you give it an Error() object). This needs to be fixed.
