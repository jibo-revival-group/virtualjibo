## Publishing

To publish, bump the version number (optional) and either publish in debug or release mode. This will generate a release/debug build before publishing and will Git push the version bump and the tag. For example:

```bash
# Bump the version, see NPM docs for more info
npm version patch|minor|major (depending on change)

# Publish in debug mode with source maps and shrinkwrapped
yarn publish:debug:shrinkwrap

# Publish in release mode, minified and shrinkwrapped
yarn publish:release:shrinkwrap
```
