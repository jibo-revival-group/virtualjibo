rule-generator
==============

Collection of functions that generate rules given data like, for example, crew members.

Reference this repository inside the dependencies section of your project's package.json. Then run yarn install.

Then you can use it like this in your code:

```
rulegen = require('rule-generator');

var user1 = {
    "userId":"uid0001",
    "first_name":"elroy",
    "middle_name":"john",
    "last_name":"jetson",
    "nick_name":"cool boy"
};

var user2 = {
    "userId":"uid0002",
    "first_name":"judy",
    "middle_name":"july",
    "last_name":"jetson",
    "nick_name":"cool lady"
};

var a = [user1, user2];
var rule = rulegen.crew2rule(a);

```

The only field that is mandatory is userId. The rest are optional. However, they must be named "first_name", "middle_name" and so on. Any field that is not first_name, middle_name, nick_name or last_name will be ignored. UserId's should only contain alphanumeric numbers.

Then you can compile the rule using the nlu service.

Use the request: COMPILE, the one that includes a URI in the request. Use as URI: "handle:crew"

To run regression tests:
```
git clone git@github.jibo.com:speech/rule-generator.git
cd rule-generator
yarn test
```
